Part 4 Compare & Contrast:

1. Yes the order does matter. For example I noticed that when the TerraBot indicated the soil was too dry first, but the light action was "queued up" ahead instead of water sometimes. Then it would take some time for the light to reach the desired level and then turn on the pump. In other instances the pump went on first then the LEDs. This meant the actuators values would jump quite quickly and sometimes overshoot the desired value. I also noticed that certain behaviors would activate the same actuators which could lead to some actuators running more than needed.

2.  The schedule or ogranized so that there is light for most of time between 9am and 10pm. Raise Temp behavior happens between the times that the lights are off and when Raise temp behavior has ended, the lower temp behavior occurs breifly afterward. Lower humid behavior happens consistenly throughout the day turnining on and off in 30 minute increments. Raise moist behavior occurs between the time that raise temp and lower temp occurs and lowerMoist happens shortly after lowerTemp in most instances. It seems that most behaviors are allowed to run alongside lowerHumid and Light. However, raiseTemp, lowerTemp, and raiseMoist do not occur in tandem. It may organized this way to mimic the conditions the plant may expierence in nature. In the layered approach, the planning layer generates the schedule which indicates what actuators should be activated. The executive layer looks at this schedule and ensures that the correct behaviors are paused before starting the next set of behaviors. The behaviorial layers looks at the behaviors that the executive wants to activate or pause and activates the actual actuators of the robot to do the desired physical actions.

3. The Layered approach is more suitable for the greenhouse agent because it is better at ensuring that behaviors that shoudln't conflict with each other don't run at the same time. The behaviorial approach is very reactive and is constantly toggling actuators which is why there were likley more failures in the behavioral agent than the layered agent. I think it was especially helpful that in the doStep funciton for the layered approach, we pause all the necessary behaviors before activating the next set.

4. They are both similiar in that both agents are interpreting some sensor data and completing some set of actions based on said data. However it seems that the greenhouse agents will follow a more predicatable set of behaviors, while the smart home system might have to be more dynamic because there is a human interacting with it and thus may have to be more reactive. I think the behaviorial architecture would be better simply because there might not be a need for scheduling because the human interacting with the system may change their habits day to day and the system should simply react to their actions and needs.
