Over the 1 minute interval, the senor values for light, temperature and humidity were relatively consistent. But there
were fluctuations in soil moisture and weight. Reservoir level saw the biggest swings going down from ~85 to 76 before stabilizing
back to 85.

When turning on the pump, we did a drop in the reservoir level from the previous sensor readings as well as 
an increase in weight. We did not see a big increase in soil moisture though, likley because there must be some delay
between added water and the moisture sensor being able to read the difference.

The primary observation here was that I noticed a significant drop in humidity from roughly 73 to 67. The other
sensors changed slighlty but that might be because of natural variability of the sensors.\

The main changes I saw here was that humidity again saw a significant decrease from 70 to ~64% indicating that
fan is quite effective at reducing humidity. I also saw a small decrease in temperature from 21 to 20.5 celcius. This
makes sense as adding wind to the system would have this effect.

Finally for light reading I observed that at light level 50 the sensor read out a 506 and then for each +50 increase
there was a roughly 100 increase in the sensor reading indicating a strong linear realtionship between the light and the 
sensor. All the other sensors had minor fluctuations but nothing significant or something I think would be caused by the lights
in a short period. Temperature increased slighly but I think if the lights were on for an extended period of time the effect would 
be more profound.

Looking at all the different readings, I realize that not all the sensors are as reactive as others and there will need to be
some predictive behaviors that understand that some sensors lag behind the actuators. If we can figure out this lag then we can better 
estimate what's happening in real time. Overall though, I was happy to see that each of the actuators led to a reasonable change in the sensors.
